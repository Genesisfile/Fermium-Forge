Fermium Forge — Proof-of-Concept Platform

A modular, agent-driven AI development environment demonstrating the early stages of a next-generation architecture.

Overview

Fermium Forge is a proof-of-concept platform that showcases how AI agents can be designed, evolved, governed, and deployed through a fully automated and constraint-driven system.
This project is not a production framework. Instead, it serves as an early technical exploration of what a next-generation, fully self-maintaining multi-agent platform could become.

The current implementation demonstrates only the beginning of the system’s full potential. Many of the deeper capabilities—advanced solver networks, full UCIR constraint architecture, continuous autogenesis, and large-scale orchestration—are represented conceptually rather than fully implemented.

Even in this early state, the project illustrates a powerful direction:

Zero-write code flow through on-demand materialization

Unified constraint graph as the core truth source

Multi-agent dev team simulation

Automated lifecycle management for agents

Test, validation, and deployment simulation

A structured environment for future intelligence-first architectures


Goals of the Proof-of-Concept

Demonstrate how agent specifications can replace traditional code structures

Explore automated development cycles driven by constraints rather than files

Visualize an agent’s full lifecycle in an accessible UI

Provide a foundation for future iterations involving hybrid solvers, distributed reasoning, and advanced orchestration models


Current Status

This repository reflects an early prototype. It includes:

The frontend UI and dashboards

Lifecycle visualization

Simulated Dev Team agent roles

Specification editing and versioning

The conceptual pipeline for validation, materialization, and testing

Example agents and mock development flows


The deeper system logic is intentionally simplified. All core architectural ideas are present, but many are represented in lightweight or mock implementations to keep the project accessible, modular, and expandable.

Roadmap

Areas planned for exploration in later iterations include:

Full UCIR (Unified Constraint IR) engine

Hybrid solver stack (SMT, MaxSAT, numeric solvers, stochastic search)

Deterministic replay system

Advanced parallel orchestration

Code materialization from constraints

Autonomous self-optimization strategies

Deployment-ready backend services


Contributing

Contributions, suggestions, and discussions are welcome.
Since this is a conceptual prototype, feedback on architecture, UI, reasoning flow, and multi-agent coordination mechanics is highly appreciated.
